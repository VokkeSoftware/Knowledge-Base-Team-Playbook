# Leave Guidelines

<h2>Overview</h2>
From time to time, you may need to take time off for a break, due to sickness or to look after your family.

Vokke is committed to supporting team members when they need to take leave. These guidelines outline team leave entitlements and the processes for applying for and taking leave.

<h2>Annual leave</h2>
In the interest of your health and wellbeing, you are encouraged to use your annual leave entitlement and take time away from work for a break or a holiday.

<h3>Entitlements</h3>
Full-time employees are entitled to 20 days of annual leave per completed year of service. Part-time employees are entitled to a pro-rata amount of leave for hours worked.

<h3>Taking annual leave</h3>
If you are planning on taking leave, you should discuss your plans with your manager as soon as possible so we can plan ahead and get everything covered while you’re away.

<h3>Leave application</h3>
Leave requests must be  submitted via <a href="https://login.xero.com/">My Xero</a>.

Your request for leave will be considered by your manager in line with business and team requirements and is not guaranteed to be approved. 

<h3>Notice for taking leave</h3>
As a guide, the following minimum notice periods for taking leave should be given:

<ul>
  <li><1 week leave = Two week notice</li>
  <li>1 - 2 weeks leave = Six weeks notice</li>
  <li>2+ weeks = Eight weeks notice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Direction to take leave</h3>
<b><ul>
  <li>Office shut down</li>
</ul></b>
The office may shut down at particular periods of the year, such as during the Christmas and New Year period. During these periods, all team members will be required to utilise their annual leave balance to cover their leave.
Where a team member doesn’t have sufficient annual leave to cover the shutdown period, leave without pay must be used.

<b><ul>
  <li>Excess leave</li>
</ul></b>
Where a team member has accrued a leave balance of 8 or more weeks, Vokke may direct the team member to take a period of paid annual leave. Where this is required, Vokke will provide at least 8 weeks notice to take leave.

<h3>Final pay</h3>
Upon termination of employment, any unused annual leave balance will be paid out to the team member in their final pay.

<h2>Personal leave</h2>
Sometimes, we need to take time off to make ourselves feel better or take care of our family. Personal leave can be used for when you are unwell for either physical or mental health reasons and / or as carer’s leave if you need to take time off to look after an immediate family member.

<h3>Entitlement</h3>
Full-time team members are entitled to 10 days of personal leave per year and this will accrual for service completed.

At the time of a team member termination, any unused leave balances will be forfeited and will not be paid out.

<h3>Notice and medical certificate</h3>
If you are unwell and will be absent from work, you should contact your manager as soon as possible to let them know that you will be away.

If you are absent from work, you will be required to provide proof of leave, such as a medical certificate. If you are unable to provide evidence of your leave, your leave may be unpaid.

<h2>Leave without pay (LWOP)</h2>
Where a team member has insufficient annual leave for the period of time they wish to take, they may supplement this with taking some time off as leave without pay.

LWOP may only be taken if a team member doesn’t have a sufficient annual leave balance or intends to take a long period of annual leave at a later date.

A maximum of two weeks (10 days) of LWOP may be taken per year.

LWOP is not a guaranteed leave entitlement and will be review by managers on a case-by-case basis.
