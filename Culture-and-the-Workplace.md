# Culture and the Workplace

<h2>Desk and office</h2>
Your desk is your space. Feel free to add whatever inspires you or keeps your hungry to learn and succeed.

<h2>Dress code</h2>
Our dress is smart-casual. This means you don't need to wear a suit or formal wear on a daily basis but please ensure that you are still well-presented.

Basically, we're saying it's ok to wear jeans and t-shirts but please avoid wearing anything with offensive logos or words, ripped clothing, ugg boots or trackies (you get the gist).

More professional clothing might be required if you have a meeting with a client, check in with your team lead if you're not sure.

<h2>Music at work</h2>
You can plug in and listen to music at work. We ask that you don't put up videos as they are too distracting.

<h2>Public parking and transport</h2>
Richmond has a lot of public transport with trains and trams close by. Our office is within wakling distance from both Richond and East Richmond train stations.

There is also ample metered street parking and various paid parking lots around the area too.

<h2>Communication expectations</h2>
Communication is king at Vokke. We are all focused on our own work so to minimise disruptions and lost productivity caused by context switching, here a few tips to communicatre effectively:

<ul>
  <li>Be conscious of the other person's time</li>
  <li>Try to avoid jargon based on your skillset. Instead, opt for terminology shared by the team</li>
  <li>Use the project's ubiquitous language. Don't invent your own terms for things</li>
  <li>Give context; the other person may have never heard of the project you're working on</li>
</ul>

We have several different channels and mediums to communicate with each other and our clients.
